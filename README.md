# Beauty Survey Data Analysis
Beauty Survey Data Analysis is a Python program designed to analyze survey data from a beauty-related questionnaire stored in a Google Sheet. This tool provides users with the ability to perform data analysis on 10 specific questions from the survey. It also allows users to contribute their own data by inputting responses into the Google Sheet. Subsequently, they can reanalyze the data, including their own contributions.

## How to Use
The Beauty Survey Data Analysis program offers a versatile and intuitive user experience through a series of interactive menus and prompts. Users can seamlessly navigate various tasks within the program:

### Menu-driven Interaction:

- Upon launching the program, users are presented with a menu featuring multiple options, providing clear paths for data input and analysis.

### Data Input:

- Option 1 allows users to input their own survey data. They are guided through ten specific questions with predefined response options.
The program ensures data accuracy, enhancing user experience and data integrity.

### Data Analysis:

- Users can select option 2 to initiate the data analysis process. They can choose one of the ten survey questions for detailed examination.
The program then prompts users to specify their preferred method of viewing the data, which includes Table, Percentage and Fractions

### Common Responses Analysis:

- Option 3 empowers users to delve into common responses across the survey questions. Users can select a specific question of interest.
and both the most and least common answers will be shown with their response count.

### User-Friendly Iteration:

- After completing each task, users are given the opportunity to seamlessly return to the main menu. This flexibility enables users to perform additional actions, ensuring a productive workflow.

### Program Termination:

- Users can choose option 4 when at the main menu (which they can be taken to by pressing enter at the end of each action), to exit the program gracefully.

- The Beauty Survey Data Analysis program prioritizes user interaction and feedback, enhancing data collection and analysis capabilities. This structured approach to interaction and data management ensures an effective and efficient user experience.

## Features

### The "Data Input" feature of this program enables users to conveniently input survey data. Here's how it works:

- Interactive Survey Questions: 
    - Users are presented with a set of predefined survey questions, each with a specific format and response options. The questions cover     various aspects of the beauty industry, from age and makeup habits to the impact of social media.
- Data Validation: 
    - The program ensures data validity by checking responses against predefined options for each question. For example, it verifies that age is an integer and that responses for other questions align with the provided choices. 
- Real-Time Data Contribution:
    - As users input their data, it becomes part of the dataset in real-time. This dynamic feature allows users to include their responses in any future analyses they choose to perform.   
- User-Friendly Interface: 
    - The interactive interface guides users through the input process, making it accessible to individuals with various levels of technical proficiency.

 The "Data Input" feature provides a simple, user-centric way to contribute to the dataset and utilize your survey data effectively. It ensures that users' inputs are immediately integrated into the program's database, enhancing the depth and richness of the dataset.
